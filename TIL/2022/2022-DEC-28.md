Today I learned to write my first PowerShell script!

# Problem Statement and Context #

We have Active Directory admin accounts that have passwords that were already expired or expiring and we send password expiry notifications automagically except not all admin accounts have an email address associated with it (so the user's didn't a notification there admin password was expired).

I found out which attribute `extensionAttribute10` weren't set when the admin accounts were setup initially so I got to work on the following
- Find which admin accounts didn't have an email value in `extensionAttrbute10`
- Limit the scope of the search to not potentially effect other accounts (in case something bad happens with the script)
- Create an array of each user so I can slice and dice their Full Name (their Full Name didn't just have their `FirstName` and `LastName` so I couldn't use any predefined objects)
- Based on the Admin User's Full Name, construct an email address from it
- Display each user's email address that will be used to set it
- Ask for input to continue or not
- Actually set the user's email address in `extensionAttribute10`

# Definition of Done

For each admin user that is still active and doesn't have an email address associated with their admin account, set it based on their Full Name

## Example

```
A Firstname LastName will have the email address: FirstName.LastName@YourCompany.com
Do you want to proceed? Y or N: y
Adding email address FirstName.LastName@YourCompany.com for user A FirstName LastName
```
